🎓 SpaceX Launch Success Prediction
This project was developed as part of our Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) semester course. It uses TensorFlow to build a neural network that predicts whether a SpaceX launch will succeed based on input features including payload, weather data, and launch conditions.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Model Accuracy: 90.24%

AUC Score: 0.80

Real-time prediction via Streamlit app

Data enriched with weather APIs: Open-Meteo, Visual Crossing, and GHCN-D

📊 Model Features:

3 Dense layers with ReLU activations

Dropout regularization

Class imbalance handled via class weighting

Input preprocessing with normalization and outlier removal
