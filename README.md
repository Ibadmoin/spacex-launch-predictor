## 🎓 Final Project: SpaceX Launch Success Prediction

This project was developed as part of our Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) semester course. It uses TensorFlow to build a neural network that predicts whether a SpaceX launch will succeed based on input features including payload, weather data, and launch conditions.

🔍 **Key Highlights**:
- **Model Accuracy:** 90.24%
- **AUC Score:** 0.80
- Real-time prediction via **Streamlit** app
- Data enriched with weather APIs: **Open-Meteo**, **Visual Crossing**, and **GHCN-D**

📊 **Model Features**:
- 3 Dense layers with ReLU activations
- Dropout regularization
- Class imbalance handled via class weighting
- Input preprocessing with normalization and outlier removal
